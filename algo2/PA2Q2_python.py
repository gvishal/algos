#In this question your task is again to i
#run the clustering algorithm from lecture, 
#but on a MUCH bigger graph. 
#So big, in fact, that the distances (i.e., edge costs) are only defined implicitly, rather than being provided as an explicit list.
#The data set is here. The format is:
#[# of nodes] [# of bits for each node's label]
#[first bit of node 1] ... [last bit of node 1]
#[first bit of node 2] ... [last bit of node 2]
#For example, the third line of the file "0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1" denotes the 24 bits associated with node #2.
#The distance between two nodes u and v in this problem is defined as the Hamming distance--- the number of differing bits --- between the two nodes' labels. For example, the Hamming distance between the 24-bit label of node #2 above and the label "0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1" is 3 (since they differ in the 3rd, 7th, and 21st bits).

#The question is: what is the largest value of k such that there is a k-clustering with spacing at least 3? That is, how many clusters are needed to ensure that no pair of nodes with all but 2 bits in common get split into different clusters?
