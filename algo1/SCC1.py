#The file contains the edges of a directed graph. 
#Vertices are labeled as positive integers from 1 to 875714. 
#Every row indicates an edge, the vertex label in first column is the tail and the vertex label in second column is the head
# (recall the graph is directed, and the edges are directed from the first column vertex to the second column vertex).
# So for example, the 11th row looks liks : "2 47646". This just means that the vertex with label 2 has an outgoing edge to the vertex with label 47646
#Your task is to code up the algorithm from the video lectures for computing strongly connected components (SCCs), and to run this algorithm on the given graph. 

#Output Format: You should output the sizes of the 5 largest SCCs in the given graph, in decreasing order of sizes, separated by commas (avoid any spaces). 
#So if your algorithm computes the sizes of the five largest SCCs to be 500, 400, 300, 200 and 100, then your answer should be "500,400,300,200,100". If your algorithm #finds less than 5 SCCs, then write 0 for the remaining terms. 
#Thus, if your algorithm computes only 3 SCCs whose sizes are 400, 300, and 100, then your answer should be #"400,300,100,0,0".
